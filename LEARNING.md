Yeah, it is easy to learn, but trust me it will be worth it. In our school life we have learing about C++ right? That means you have enough knowledge to go ahead with JS. Also, JS that runs on browser, is vanilla JS, NodeJS is an advancement of vanilla JS. 

### Roadmap

To start with NodeJS, first learn about classic web stack (HTML,JS,CSS), refer to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). On its completion, go ahead with some udemy courses.
